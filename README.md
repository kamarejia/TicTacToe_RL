# TicTacToe_RL

# Description
tictactoe_game.py can be run to play against agents trained with tictactoe_learning.py in three difficulty levels. 
tictactoe_learning.py can be used for Monte Carlo reinforcement learning by tuning hyperparameters. 

# Usage
The game starts when tictactoe_game.py is executed with images, music, and Q_function in the same hierarchy.

# Handling 
tictactoe_game.py starts the game when you click on the difficulty level. The game can be played backwards and marks can be placed by clicking anywhere. 
After the winner is determined, click again to go to the difficulty selection screen. The escape key ends the game.

# Requirements
- numpy      1.24.1
- pygame     2.1.2
